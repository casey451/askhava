# For Casey's review

These are decisions Claude made on its own and logged so the build never waits (`BUILD_BRIEF.md:542`). None of them blocks anything. Each item names its entry in `docs/decisions.md`, which has the exact source lines. The ones most worth a second look come first.

## From K2 (the spec), October 27, 2026

**Worth a second look**

1. **Texting STOP (or a bare "cancel") no longer closes a homeowner's open jobs.** The older blueprint closed them; the newer changes file says a one-word opt-out only stops texts. The job carries on through the quote page and email, and ends by "CLOSE 1042", the close button or its normal timeouts. (D-005)
2. **Quiet hours are 8 a.m. to 8 p.m.**, in both Arizona time and the time zone of the person's area code. Replies the person just asked for (STOP/HELP answers, pick codes, a reply within 15 minutes of their text) and urgent safety texts still go out at night. If an area code's time zone is unknown, only hours that are daytime everywhere in the US are used. (D-003, D-025)
3. **"Business hours" for deadlines are 8 a.m. to 8 p.m. Arizona time, every day.** The 2-hour Confirm window and the 1-hour card fix only count during those hours. (D-004)
4. **Fee tiers at the exact edges:** a $500.00 quote is $75 and a $1,500.00 quote is $75; $1,500.01 is $199. The old "major job" flag no longer changes the fee. (D-009)
5. **Recurring prices that aren't monthly** (weekly, every two weeks, quarterly, yearly) are turned into a monthly price first, then counted as 4 months. (D-010)
6. **Masked calls, after 2 wrong PINs:** the line reads back the homeowner's first name and street only to a phone already linked to the business that paid for that job. Anyone else hears nothing and is refused. (D-026)
7. **Quote-count update texts** go out at most once every 3 hours per job. (D-012)
8. **The free first win** counts "first 90 days" from the day you go live (Gate C). (D-019)
9. **Split-job check window for handymen:** 30 days. (D-027)

**Routine (filling a gap or taking the newer rule)**

- Homeowners see quotes from the first one, and businesses have 24 hours (every day) to quote. (D-011)
- Data is kept per the brief's retention table: contact details 180 days after a job closes, photos 30 days, texting records 5 years, money and audit records 7 years. (D-013)
- Sign-in: businesses by emailed link plus a text code on new devices; you by password plus passkey or authenticator, sessions up to 12 hours; homeowners by phone plus a texted code. (D-014, D-015)
- Businesses are paused after 3 complaints in 90 days, not on the first one; every complaint still alerts you. (D-016)
- Licenses are checked against the ROC's daily lists plus a live lookup at each pick; a failed lookup never changes a verified status. (D-017)
- Natural "please stop texting me" counts as an opt-out; the STOP reply says "To use Ask Hava again, text START." (D-006, D-007)
- In an emergency, the safety text goes before the consent text. (D-008)
- Consent replies OK, Yes, Sure and Sí are all accepted. (D-021)
- No weekly card limit for businesses; they control volume with their job types, towns and pause. (D-028)
- Spec format: one testable sentence per requirement with its source line, checked by `scripts/trace_spec.py`; written in one session. (D-001, D-002)
- Smaller wording and naming items: D-018, D-020, D-022, D-023, D-024.
